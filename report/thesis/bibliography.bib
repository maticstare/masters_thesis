  abstract       = {Transition curves are a useful tool for lateral alignment of railway segments. Their design is important to ensure safe and comfortable travel for passengers and cargo. Well designed transition curves can lead to reduced wear of tracks and vehicles, which is beneficial from a maintenance point of view. Extensive studies have been performed through decades to find transition curves that can replace existing railway segments for the purpose of enhancing certain properties. Those studies seek to form curves that satisfy desired evaluation criteria, which are often connected to geometric continuity between the curve segments, and vehicle dynamics, to secure a smooth ride. This research topic is still ongoing and active at present. Recent results and findings are in line with the developments on the topic of vehicle dynamics and within the railway industry. For this reason it is appropriate to collect and discuss the latest work, since there are no up-to-date detailed literature reviews available. This paper explores the present state-of-the-art of railway transition curves, and identifies some of the research challenges and future research opportunities in the field.},

  abstract       = {Track geometry measurements (TGMs) are a critical methodology for assessing the quality of track regularities and, thus, are essential for ensuring the safety and comfort of high-speed railway (HSR) operations. TGMs also serve as foundational datasets for engineering departments to devise daily maintenance and repair strategies. During routine maintenance, S-shaped long-wave irregularities (SLIs) were found to be present in the vertical direction from track geometry cars (TGCs) at the beginning and end of a vertical curve (VC). In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis and comparison of the characteristics of these SLIs and design a long-wave filter for simulating inertial measurement systems (IMSs). This simulation experiment conclusively demonstrates that SLIs are not attributed to track geometric deformation from the design reference. Instead, imperfections in the longitudinal profile's design are what cause abrupt changes in the vehicle's acceleration, resulting in the measurement output of SLIs. Expanding upon this foundation, an additional investigation concerning the quantitative relationship between SLIs and longitudinal profiles is pursued. Finally, a method that involves the addition of a third-degree parabolic transition curve (TDPTC) or a full-wave sinusoidal transition curve (FSTC) is proposed for a smooth transition between the slope and the circular curve, designed to eliminate the abrupt changes in vertical acceleration and to mitigate SLIs. The correctness and effectiveness of this method are validated through filtering simulation experiments. These experiments indicate that the proposed method not only eliminates abrupt changes in vertical acceleration, but also significantly mitigates SLIs.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the Euler-Rodrigues formula in the axis-angle representation of rotations, studies its variations and derivations in different mathematical forms as vectors, quaternions and Lie groups and investigates their intrinsic connections. The Euler-Rodrigues formula in the Taylor series expansion is presented and its use as an exponential map of Lie algebras is discussed particularly with a non-normalized vector. The connection between Euler-Rodrigues parameters and the Euler-Rodrigues formula is then demonstrated through quaternion conjugation and the equivalence between quaternion conjugation and an adjoint action of the Lie group is subsequently presented. The paper provides a rich reference for the Euler-Rodrigues formula, the variations and their connections and for their use in rigid body kinematics, dynamics and computer graphics.}
